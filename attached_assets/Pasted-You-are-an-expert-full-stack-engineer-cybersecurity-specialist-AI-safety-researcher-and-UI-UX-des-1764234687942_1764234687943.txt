You are an expert full-stack engineer, cybersecurity specialist, AI safety researcher, and UI/UX designer. Your task is to build a complete, production-ready hackathon project called:
“SafeSpace AI – The Digital Violence Early-Warning & Survivor Support System.”

This solution must directly align with the theme “UNiTE to End Digital Violence Against All Women & Girls.”

🎯 Project Requirements

Build a working prototype with three main components:

1️⃣ Browser Extension – Real-Time Harm Detection

A Chrome/Firefox extension with:

Core Features

Detect harmful, abusive, threatening, or coercive messages in real time.

Use a lightweight toxicity/abuse classifier (e.g., small HF model or logistic regression) that runs locally/offline if possible.

Scan:

typed messages

received DMs

comments

online content

Show a popup alert when harmful content is detected:

“Warning — This message may be harmful”

Provide quick action buttons.

Actions Menu

Include buttons for:

Hide content

Copy safe-report template

Capture screenshot for evidence

Open SafeSpace Support Hub

Tips for staying safe

Technical Requirements

Manifest V3

Content scripts + background service worker

Secure permissions

No user data sent to external servers unless explicitly required

2️⃣ Web App – Survivor Support & Safety Hub

A beautiful, responsive React + Tailwind frontend and Flask backend.

Core Pages

Landing Page (Mission, Safety Message, Features)

Support Hub

Step-by-step guidance

Safety tips

Online protection checklists

Encrypted Evidence Locker

Upload text/screenshot

Encrypt in browser with AES

Store encrypted version only

Digital Literacy Mini-Courses

Password safety

Privacy

Spotting manipulation

Local/Regional Support Directory

ML Insights Dashboard

Show weekly “Exposure to Harm” rating

Simple toxicity stats

Visual heatmap

UI/UX Requirements

Dark mode (default)

Soft gradients + calm, empowering theme

Big typography

Minimalistic layouts

Mobile-first

3️⃣ Backend (Flask API)

Build secure, clean APIs:

Endpoints

/analyze → analyze text toxicity via ML

/encrypt → AES encryption

/evidence → upload & store encrypted file

/resources → list safety resources

/stats → return user analytics (local storage or mock DB)

Security

Input validation

CORS protection

Rate limiting

Completely avoid storing unencrypted user data

🧠 Machine Learning Requirements

Use a lightweight model such as:

HuggingFace unitary/toxic-bert

textattack/bert-base-uncased-ag-news (fine-tuned)

DistilBERT with toxicity head

OR a simple TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model

Must detect:

Harassment

Sexual coercion

Threats

Hate

Identity attacks

Manipulative language

Provide confidence scores.

📦 Deliverables

You MUST generate all required code and files:

Files to produce

Full browser extension folder

React project scaffolded + components

Flask backend project

ML model code (local)

Encryption utilities

API documentation

README.md

Architecture diagram (ASCII or Mermaid)

Instructions to run locally

Deployment instructions (optional)

🧪 Testing

Include:
