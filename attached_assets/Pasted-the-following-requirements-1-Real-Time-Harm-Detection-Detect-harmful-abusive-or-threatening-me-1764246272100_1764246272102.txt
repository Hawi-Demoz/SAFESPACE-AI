the following requirements:

1. Real-Time Harm Detection

Detect harmful, abusive, or threatening messages in real time on web pages (social media, chat platforms, comments).

Use a lightweight ML model (local or browser-based) to classify messages as:

Harassment

Threat

Sexual abuse / coercion

Identity attacks

Hate speech

The detection must run locally (no server required).

2. Popup Warning UI

Show a popup when harmful content is detected.

Popup includes:

Warning message (“This message may be harmful”)

Action buttons: Hide content, Save evidence (encrypted), Open support hub, How to report

UI should be clean, minimalistic, and mobile-friendly.

3. Evidence Capture & Security

Capture screenshots or text of harmful messages.

Encrypt them locally (AES or equivalent) before storing.

Provide a way to send them safely to the web app’s support hub.

4. Extension Settings

Allow the user to:

Enable/disable detection

Adjust sensitivity thresholds

Manage saved evidence

Store settings securely in browser storage.

5. Seamless Web App Integration

Connect the extension with the main web app:

Open support pages

Push captured evidence

Share user preferences (securely)

6. Clean Code & Documentation

Generate all required files: manifest.json, contentScript.js, background.js, popup.html, popup.js, styles.css

Include comments explaining code logic.

Provide a step-by-step README for installation, running, and testing.

⭐ Additional Instructions

Make it fully compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox (Manifest V3).

Ensure performance is fast and light-weight.

Focus on user privacy & security — no user data leaves the browser unencrypted.

Make it visually impressive for a hackathon demo.

Include a mock ML model if necessary for demo purposes.

Outcome

The extension should:

Detect harmful content in real time

Alert the user with an actionable popup

Securely save evidence

Integrate with the main web app

Be fully functional, polished, and ready for presentation
